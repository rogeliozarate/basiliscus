# Basiliscus

## A ruby script to grab website snapshots
### Under construction
This is by far not an optimal solution.

## Notes
### Works on my machine 
#### Stack
* OS X
* Ruby 2.0.0-p0
* selenium
* chrome driver

Before running install Chrome driver 

```bash
brew install chromedriver
```
Type target address in the web browser address bar, like:
```bash
http://localhost:4567/github.com/rogeliozarate
````

###It works!
